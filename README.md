# randomAlloys
Python Code to generate random alloy structures

This code takes an matrix as input which contains two types of atoms in a crystal represented by 0 and 1 (e.g. In and As). It then
use a Metropolis Monte Carlo scheme to minimize the SQS (a measure of randomnes) of the crystal by performing permutations of atoms.
